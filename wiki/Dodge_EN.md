# More About the Dodge Mechanic (Dash)

The mod allows the character to perform a dash **without needing any accessory** that would normally provide this ability.

A dash consumes **30** stamina. If you don’t have enough stamina, the dash simply won’t start.

Immediately after the dash begins, the character gains **invincibility frames**, which completely protect them from any type of damage. During this state, the character can also phase through enemies.

The number of invincibility frames can be increased by raising the **Resistance** stat.

After the dash ends, there is cooldown, during which you **cannot dash**, even if you have enough stamina!
